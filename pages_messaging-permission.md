## Template: pages_messaging permission for public chatbot in facebook messenger

### Tell us how you're using this permission or feature
```
I‘m building a chatbot with the Messenger Platform. I want that my chatbot will help me automatically answering people question (Ask about our services). Now, my chatbot only works with my Facebook account (the account created the chatbot) and Tester account, so I need the "pages_messaging" permission to make chatbot also works with others Facebook account (working public).

As for your feedback, nice to hear from you guys, maybe something went wrong. We noticed that you were using a non-Tester account and the chatbot was blocked from responding to you by Facebook, even though we saw that the chatbot replied to you in the chat from our database. We have tried using the service for the Administrator and Tester roles and it is working fine. Can you please use our Tester account to test the chatbot, we will provide one below. We make sure the chatbot is well tested and works well with our Tester and Developer accounts. Thanks.

-- Facebook tester account (Tester account in my Chatbot):
+ Email: ---@gmail.com
